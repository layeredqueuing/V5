\fBlqn2csv\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIfiles \.\|.\|.\fR
.br
\fBlqn2csv\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIdirectory\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBLqn2csv\fR is used to extract the output from the LQN solvers
\fBlqns\fR(1), \fBlqsim\fR(1) and
\fBpetrisrvn\fR(1) and print them in a format suitable for plotting
with \fBgnuplot\fR(1) or loading into a spreadsheet.

The options to \fBlqn2csv\fR are used to select the results from a
model solution to extract and print.  The results are output in the
order that the options are given, separated by commas. Unlike
\fBsrvndiff(1)\fP, the model files do \fInot\fP have to be the same;
\fBlqn2csv\fP simply searches for results that match the arguments.
and, unlike SPEX or LQX model files, results can be extracted from
any entity listed below; not just those with result variables.
If no match is found (or if an argument is not specified correctly),
the string ``NULL'' is output. 

The arguments to \fBlqn2csv\fR are a list of file names. If a
directory is supplied as an argument, the directory is searched for
all files the end in \fI\-*.lqxo\fP, \fI*.lqxo~*~\fP, \fI\-*.lqjo\fP, 
or \fI.lqjo~*~\fP, in that order (i.e., the results from SPEX or LQX
runs, or the results from using \fB\-\-print-interval\fR with
\fBlqns(1)\fP or \fBlqsim(1)\fB).  The name of the directory up to any
suffix must match the name of result files,
e.g. \fIfoo.d/foo-001.lqxo\fP.
Parseable output, \fI*.p\fR, is not supported for the directory
version of the command at this time.

except for \fB\-\-arguments\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP, and
\fB\-\-version\fP.  Options can appear on both the command line and in
one or more occurances of \fB\-\-arguments\fR.

variable for plotting.
.TP 8
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-task\-mulitplicity=\fItask\fR
Print the number of copies of \fItask\fP.  Generally for reference
tasks (clients), this is the number of customers.  For all serving

\fIentity\fP.  If both a task and a processor share a common name,
then the results for the task will be printed.  Note that all the
probabilities (if any) will be printed so columns may not line up if
the result is used with others.
