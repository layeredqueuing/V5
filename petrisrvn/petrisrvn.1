.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBPetrisrvn\fR is used to analytically solve stochastice rendezvous networks
using GreatSPN.  Refer to \fI``The Stochastic
Rendezvous Network Model for Performance of Synchronous Multi-tasking
Distributed Software''\fR for details of the model.  Refer to
\fI``SRVN Input File Format''\fR for a complete description of the
input file format for the programs.  See below for program
restrictions and limits.
.PP
\fBPetrisrvn\fR reads its input from \fIfilename\fR, specified at the
command line if present, or from the standard input otherwise.  By
default, output for an input file \fIfilename\fR specified on the
command line will be placed in the file \fIfilename\fB.out\fR.  If the
\fB\-p\fP switch is used, parseable output will also be written into
\fIfilename\fB.p\fR. If XML input is used, results will be written
back to the original input file.  This behaviour can be changed using
the \fB\-o\fIoutput\fR switch, described below.  If several files are
named, then each is treated as a separate model and output will be
placed in separate output files.  If input is from the standard input,
output will be directed to the standard output.  The file name `\-' is
used to specify standard input.
.PP
The \fB\-o\fIoutput\fR option can be used to direct output to the file
\fIoutput\fR regardless of the source of input.  Output will be XML if
XML input is used, parseable output if the \fB\-p\fP switch is used,
and normal output otherwise.  Multiple input files cannot be specified
when using this option.  Output can be directed to standard output by
using \fB\-o\fI\-\fR (i.e., the output file name is `\fI\-\fR'.)
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR
Turn on debugging output.  Dump task and entry information showing
internal index numbers.  This option is useful for determining the
names of the servers and tasks since the parasol output routines do no
emit this information at present.  Output is directed to stdout unless
redirected using \fB\-m \fIfile\fR.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR
Output results in JSON format.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR
Keep all results from the solution of the petrinet.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Read input, but do not solve.  No output is generated.
.TP
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR
Direct analysis results to \fIoutput\fR.  A filename of `\fI\-\fR'
directs output to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Generate parseable output suitable as input to other programs such as
\fBsrvndiff\fR and \fBmultisrvn\fR. The parseable output is sent to an
output file, one for each input file specified, determined from its
corresponding input file by the addition of \fB.p\fR.  If standard
input is used as the input source, then the parseable output is output
to the standard output device.  In this case, only parseable output is
emitted.  If the \fB-o\fR \fIoutput\fR option is used, the parseable
output is sent to a file whose name is derived from \fIoutput\fR by
the addition of the suffix \fB.p\fR.  If a suffix already exists on
\fIoutput\fR then that suffix is replaced.
.TP
\fB\-P\fI pragma[=value]\fR
Set \fIpragma\fP to value.  See the section on pragmas below.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Reread a preexisting, solved model (generated using \fB\-k\fR).
.TP
\fB\-w\fR
Ignore warnings.  The default is to print out all warnings.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Display solution execution.  For \fBpetrisrvn\fP, the
output of the various petrinet solution stages is shown.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Display version number.  
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Output results in XML format.
.TP
\fB\-\-disjoin\-customers\fR
Create copies for reference tasks, rather that using a single task
with multiple tokens. (increases state space)
\fB\-\-no\-header\fR
Do not print out the Result Variable header when running with SPEX input.
This option has no effect otherwise.
.TP
\fB\-\-overtaking[=ARG]\fR
Find in-service and overtaking probabilities (increases state
space). ARG=task.
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-limit=ARG\fR
Set the queue size at a task for any open arrivals or asynchronous
sends to ARG.  This amount is in addition to the possible of customers
that can arrive through rendezvous requests.
.TP
\fB\-\-random\-processors\fR
Use random queueing at all processors (reduces state space).
.TP
\fB\-\-random\-queueing\fR
Use random queueing at all tasks and processors (reduces state space).
.TP
\fB\-\-reload-lqx\fR
Re-run the LQX/SPEX program without re-solving the models.  Results must exist from a previous solution run.
This option is useful if LQX print statements or SPEX results are changed.
.TP
\fB\-\-restart\fR
Re-run the LQX/SPEX program without re-solving models which were
solved successfully.  Models which were not solved successfully because of state
space explosion, will be solved again.
This option is useful for running a second pass with different options
to reduce the state space.
.TP
\fB\-\-simplify\fR
Remove redundant parts of the net such as single place processors.
.TP
\fB\-\-spacing=ARG\fR
Set the spacing between places and transition to ARG for the GreatSPN editor (the default is
3).  
\fB\-\-debug-lqx\fR
Output debugging information as an LQX program is being parsed.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug-xml\fR
Output XML elements and attributes as they are being parsed.   Since the XML parser usually stops when it encounters an error,
this option can be used to localize the error.
.SH "PRAGMAS"
.TP
\fBforce-random-queueing\fR=\fI(true,false}\fP

arrival rate exceeds the service rate of a server.
\fIArg\fP must be one of: 
.RS
.TP
\fBfalse\fP
Stop if messages are lost.
.TP
\fBtrue\fP
Ignore queue overflows for open arrivals and send-no-reply requests.
If a queue overflows, its waiting times is reported as infinite.

.TP
\fBtask-scheduling\fR=\fIarg\fP
Set the scheduling for messsages arriving at the task to \fIarg\fP.
.RS
.TP
\fBFIFO\fP
Force all tasks to use first-come, first-served scheduling.
.TP
\fBRAND\fP

(reduces state space)
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fBPetrisrvn\fR exits with 0 on success, 1 if the model failed to converge,
2 if the input was invalid, 4 if a command line argument was
incorrect, 8 for file read/write problems and -1 for fatal errors.  If
multiple input files are being processed, the exit code is the
bit-wise OR of the above conditions.
