.SH "NAME"
lqns \- solve layered queueing network models.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.B lqns
[\fIOPTIONS\fR].\|.\|. [\fIFILE\fR] \&.\|.\|.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBLqns\fP is used to solve layered queueing network models using 
analytic techniques.  Models can be specified using the LQN modeling
language, or with extensible markup language (XML).  Refer to the
\fI``Layered Queueing Network Solver and Simulator User Manual''\fP
for details of the model and for a complete description of the input file
formats for the program.
.PP
\fBLqns\fP reads its input from \fIfilename\fR, specified at the
command line if present, or from the standard input otherwise.  By
default, output for an input file \fIfilename\fR specified on the
command line will be placed in the file \fIfilename\fB.out\fR.  If the
\fB\-p\fP switch is used, parseable output will also be written into
\fIfilename\fB.p\fR. If XML input or the \fB\-x\fP switch is used, XML output will be written to 
\fIfilename\fB.lqxo\fR.  This behaviour can be changed using the
\fB\-o\fP\fIoutput\fR switch, described below.  If several files are
named, then each is treated as a separate model and output will be
placed in separate output files.  If input is from the standard input,
output will be directed to the standard output.  The file name `\fI-\fR' is
used to specify standard input.
.PP
The \fB\-o\fP\fIoutput\fR option can be used to direct output to the file
\fIoutput\fR regardless of the source of input.  Output will be XML
if XML input or if the \fB\-x\fP switch is used, parseable output if the \fB\-p\fP switch is used,
and normal output otherwise.  Multiple input files cannot be specified
when using this option.  Output can be directed to standard output by
using \fB\-o\fP\fI-\fR (i.e., the output file name is `\fI-\fR'.)
.SH "OPTIONS"

\fBstop-on-message-loss\fP pragma below.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-fast-linearizer\fR

.TP
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIarg\fR
Direct analysis results to \fIoutput\fP.  A filename of `\fI-\fR'
directs output to standard output.  If \fIoutput\fR is a directory, all output is saved in
\fIoutput/input.out\fR. If the input model contains a SPEX program with loops, the SPEX output is sent to
\fIoutput\fR; the individual model output files are found in the directory
\fIoutput.d\fR. If \fBlqns\fP is invoked with this
option, only one input file can be specified.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-parseable\fR
Generate parseable output suitable as input to other programs such as
\fBlqn2ps(1)\fP and \fBsrvndiff(1)\fP.  If input is from
\fIfilename\fR, parseable output is directed to \fIfilename\fB.p\fR.
If standard input is used for input, then the parseable output is sent
to the standard output device.  If the \fB\-o\fP\fIoutput\fR option is used, the
parseable output is sent to the file name \fIoutput\fR.
(In this case, only parseable output is emitted.)

Synchronous calls are shown using , 
asynchronous calls are shownn using , and 
processor calls are shown using .
.TP
\fB\-\-debug-json\fR

this option can be used to localize the error.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug-lqx\fR
Output debugging information as an LQX program is being parsed.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug-srvn\fR
Output debugging information while parsing SRVN input.This is the output of the Bison LALR parser.

.PP
\fBLqns\fP exits with 0 on success, 1 if the model failed to converge,
2 if the input was invalid, 4 if a command line argument was
incorrect, 8 for file read/write problems and -1 for fatal errors.  If
multiple input files are being processed, the exit code is the
bit-wise OR of the above conditions.
.SH "PRAGMAS"
\fIPragmas\fP are used to alter the behaviour of the solver in a
variety of ways.  They can be specified in the input file with

\fIArg\fP must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0.
The SPEX underrelaxation only applies if SPEX the convergence section is present in the input file.
.TP
\fBstop-on-message-loss\fR=\fIarg\fR
This pragma is used to control the operation of the solver when the
arrival rate exceeds the service rate of a server.
\fIArg\fP must be one of: 
.RS
.TP
\fBno\fP
Stop if messages are lost.
.TP
\fByes\fP
Ignore queue overflows for open arrivals and send-no-reply requests.  If a queue overflows, its waiting times is reported as infinite..LP
The default is no.
.RE
.TP
\fBtau\fR=\fIarg\fR
Set the tau adjustment factor to \fIarg\fP.
\fIArg\fP must be an integer between 0 and 25.
A value of \fIzero\fP disables the adjustment.
.TP
\fBthreads\fR=\fIarg\fR
This pragma is used to change the behaviour of the solver when solving
models with fork-join interactions.
.RS
.TP
\fBexponential\fP
Use exponential values instead of three-point approximations in all approximations.
.TP
\fBhyper\fP
Inflate overlap probabilities based on arrival instant estimates.
.TP
\fBmak\fP
Use Mak-Lundstrom approximations for join delays.
.TP
\fBnone\fP
Do not perform overlap calculation for forks.
.LP
The default is hyper.
.RE
.TP
\fBvariance\fR=\fIarg\fR
This pragma is used to choose the variance calculation used by the solver.
.RS
.TP
\fBinit-only\fP
Initialize the variances, but don't recompute as the model is solved.
.TP
\fBmol\fP
Use the MOL variance calculation.
.TP
\fBno-entry\fP
By default, any task with more than one entry will use the variance calculation.  This pragma will switch off the variance calculation for tasks with only one entry.
.TP
\fBnone\fP
Disable variance adjustment.  All stations in the MVA submodels are either delay- or FIFO-servers.
.TP
\fBstochastic\fP

.SH "STOPPING CRITERIA"
\fBLqns\fP computes the model results by iterating through a set of
submodels until either convergence is achieved, or the iteration limit
is hit. Convergence is determined by taking the root of the mean of
the squares of the difference in the utilization of all of the servers
from the last two iterations of the MVA solver over the all of the
submodels then comparing the result to the convergence value specified
in the input file. If the RMS change in utilization is less than
convergence value, then the results are considered valid.
.PP
If the model fails to converge, three options are available:
.TP 3
1.
reduce the under-relaxation coefficient. Waiting and idle times are
propogated between submodels during each iteration. The
under-relaxation coefficient determines the amount a service time is
changed between each iteration. A typical value is 0.7 - 0.9; reducing
it to 0.1 may help.
.TP 3
2.
increase the iteration limit. The iteration limit sets the upper bound
on the number of times all of the submodels are solved. This value may
have to be increased, especially if the under-relaxation coefficient
is small, or if the model is deeply nested. The default value is 50
iterations.
.TP 3
3.
increase the convergence test value. Note that the convergence value
is the standard deviation in the change in the utilization of the
servers, so a value greater than 1.0 makes no sense.
.PP
The convergence value can be observed using \fB\-t\fP\fIconvergence\fP flag.
.SH "MODEL LIMITS"
The following table lists the acceptable parameter types for

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
Most diagnostic messages result from errors in the input file.
If the solver reports errors, then no solution will be generated for
the model being solved.  Models which generate warnings may not be
correct.  However, the solver will generate output.
.PP
Sometimes the model fails to converge, particularly if there are several
heavily utilized servers in a submodel.  Sometimes, this problem can
be solved by reducing the value of the under-relaxation coefficient.  It
may also be necessary to increase the iteration-limit, particularly if
there are many submodels.  With replicated models, it may be necessary
to use `srvn' layering to get the model to converge.  Convergence can be tracked
using the \fB\-t\fP\fIconvergence\fP option.
.PP
The solver will sometimes report some servers with `high' utilization.
This problem is the result of some of the approximations used, in particular, two-phase servers.
Utilizations in excess of 10\% are likely the result of failures in the solver.
Please send us the model file so that we can improve the algorithms.
