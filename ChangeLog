	- these programs now all accept both the lqns input file format
	  and XML input.  See lqn.xsd and lnq-core.xsd for the XML schema
	  definitions.
	- Waiting times for processor scheduling are now reported on a
	  per-entry (or activity) basis instead of a per-slice basis.

2003-10-09  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* multisrvn (V2_18)
	- MultiSRVN is now compiled and built for Win32.
	- MultiSRVN now uses Perl as it's expression evaluation engine.
	  This may mean changes to complicated expresssions -- in
	  particular the '^' (exponentiation) operator is now '**'.

2003-09-25  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* lqns
	- The ignoreopen=<nn> pragma has been removed and replaced with
	  stop-on-message-loss=(false|true).  If set to true, the solver
	  will allow queues to grow to infinity (because the arrival rate
	  is too large for the server).  If set to false, the solver will
	  stop.

	* parasrvn
	- The "halt-on-loss" pragma has been renamed to
	  "stop-on-message-loss" to match with lqns.
	- If a queue overflows and stop-on-message-loss = false, the
	  corresponding result will be set to infinity.  Queues are fixed
	  at 1024 items.

	* srvniolib
	- "inf" and "infinity" are reserved words in the output which
	  indicate an infinite result.  The parseable output scanner will
	  pass "infinity" to applications such as srvndiff, multisrvn and
	  srvn2eepic.

2003-09-24  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* multisrvn

	* srvn2eepic
	- The +C option will colour input files based on their layer
	  (provided that NO results are present).  The default is to not
	  colourize input.

2003-09-10  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* srvniolib
	- A Queue length parameter (q <nn>) was added to the task
	  definition for yygram.y
	- A drop probability field was added to the xxgram.y

	* multisrvn

	  length.
	- '.dp' and '.dpc' were added to the result catagories to extract
	  the message drop probabilities.

2003-09-08  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* multisrvn
	- Added '.tq' to vary task queue length.
	- Added '.dp' and '.dpc' to extract message drop probabilities for
	  send-no-replies and open arrivals.

2003-09-04  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* srvn2eepic
	- The -l option (print layer number) has been moved to -Z.
	- The -l option is now used to control the output of the message
	  loss probability for send-no-replies and open-arrivals.

2003-08-13  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* srvndiff
	- The -A option (print the absolute value of an error) was moved
	  to -M (magnitude).
	- +A enables all comparison output except for variances. +AA
	  outputs variances too. -AA disables all output.  Options are
	  processed from left to right, the last option processed takes
	  precedence.

	* srvn2eepic
	- Now compiles and runs on windows.

2003-07-20  greg franks  <rgfranks@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

	* Lqns
	- Join delays are now reported from the fork to the join.
	- Multiserver fixes for large number of copies and missing chains.
