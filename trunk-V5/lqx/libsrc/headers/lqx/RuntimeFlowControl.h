/*
 * PREAMBLE: Please remember that using Exceptions as a Flow Control mechanism is NEVER
 * the right thing to do, not even now. Nope, not even now. The problem is that we are backed
 * into a corner somewhat. Since the idea was to carry out the execution of LQX code before
 * even generating an intermediate representation, there is no other reasonable approach.
 * Since there is no requirement for this to be exceptionally fast and we have an existing
 * framework to fit into this probably needs to happen. SPECIAL care will be taken to
 * ensure that leaks will not occur.
 *
 * For the future: Adding some sort of Virtual Machine or IR code is the best thing to do
 * and will totally eliminate the need for this ugly, ugly hack.
