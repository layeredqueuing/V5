Notes on PARASOL 3.1 Release D
------------------------------

Professor John Neilson, who wrote most of PARASOL, told me 
that he is "out of the picture with respect to PARASOL".  Since he
released version 3.1, I have found and fixed a number of bugs in
the source and added a few features.  I thought that I would 
make another release to share what I've done.  

In this release I have also merged in some code that
Greg Franks has written, specifically, messages with priorities and 
some functionality around the added "sched_time".  (Look at it in the code.)

I, personally, have added a call "ps_curr_priority", which gives the
priority that a specified host on a specified node is currently running
at.

Recently, Greg Franks has changed the Makefile structure and etc. to
use automake/autoconf.  Hopefully this work can soon be integrated.
