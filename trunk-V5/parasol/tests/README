This directory contains the source code for PARASOL kernel test
programs as well as a Makefile for their creation. Included is the
script "run_tests" which executes all of the test programs reporting
errors discovered to stderr - you can safely ignore "Empty calendar"
messages from test12 and the invalid parameter tests. Included are the
following tests:

      Program Name		Exercises

	test01			Links and messages
	test02			Buses and messages
	test03			Send and receive variants
	test04			Shared ports
	test05			Statistics
	test06			Spinlocks
	test07			Semaphores
	test08			Port passing
	test09			Port sets
	test10			Create/kill (memory leaks)
	test11			Resume, suspend, awaken, sleep, & 
				compute
	test12			Info functions
	test13			Scheduling
	test14			PR scheduling
	test15			RR fairness
	test16			Sync
	test17			Migrate
	test18			User scheduling
	invalid			Invalid parameters
	randtest		Randomness check (ports and buses)

Noted unresolved problems include:

test03	fails under Mach with an Invalid Time Stamp error.  This 
	appears to result from a bug in the sscanf function 
	(possibly as a result of using an old version of gcc).

test10	fails under NextStep and IRIX because the code "wrapper" 
	approach to catching tasks which "run off the end" doesn't 
	seem to work under for some reason.
