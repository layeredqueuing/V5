This directory contains some PARASOL tools included with version 3.1.
These include of the Parasol Distributed Simulation Manager (DPSM), the
XTG filter files and the ParaGraph filter. Since DPSM requires the PVM
library, its makefile will require customizing - consequently, the DPSM
tool is not automatically made.

The files for DPSM are:

Makefile.dpsm	- A sample Makefile for making the dpsm package.
dpsm.c		- The dpsm "master" program.
dpss.c		- The dpsm slave program.
dpsm.h		- Some defines used in both dpsm.c and dpss.c.
simfile		- An example dpsm input file.

The files for the XTG filter are:

Makefile.xtg	- A make file for the xtg_filter program.
xtg_filter.c	- The xtg filter program.
PARASOL.oop	- The MLog event stream interpreter.

The file for the ParaGraph filter is:

pgfilter.awk	- An awk script which makes up the paragraph filter.
