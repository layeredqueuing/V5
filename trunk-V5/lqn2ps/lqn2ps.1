.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlqn2ps\fR, \fBlqn2lqn\fR, \fBlqn2xml\fR, and \fBlqn2out\fR
are used to transform an LQN input file (with results) into:
graphical output such as PostScript,
a new old-style input file,
a new XML input/output file,
and textual output respectively.
In general, the name of the program is used to specify the output format, 
although the \fB\-O\fR switch always overrides this behaviour.
Refer to the \fB\-O\fR switch described below for the output formats supported.
.PP
\fBlqn2ps\fR reads its input from \fIfilename\fR, specified at the
command line if present, or from the standard input otherwise.  Output
for an input file \fIfilename\fR specified on the command line will be
placed in the file \fIfilename.ext\fR, where \fI.ext\fR depends on the
conversion taking place (see the \fB\-O\fR switch).
If \fBlqn2lqn\fR or \fBlqn2xml\fR is used to reformat an existing LQN-type or XML input file respectively,
the output is written back to the original file name.
The original file is renamed to \fIfilename\fB~\fR.
If several input files are given, then each is treated as a separate model and
output will be placed in separate output files.  This behaviour can be changed
using the \fB\-o\fR option, described below.  If input is from the
standard input, output will be directed to the standard output.  The
file name `\-' is used to specify standard input.
.SH "OPTIONS"

\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-aggregate=\fIobjects\fR
