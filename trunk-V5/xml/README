The .xsd files exist in two repositories: this one and lqn-tools on
rads-cvs.sce.carleton.ca.  They must be kept in sync.  

The .rnc files (Relax-NG Compact) are schema files used for
context-sensitive editing using nxml mode in emacs.  See
http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/.  They are derived from the
xsd files using rngconv. 

java -jar rngconv.jar   lqn-sub.xsd > lqn-sub.rng
java -cp trang.jar:jing.jar:crimson.jar com.thaiopensource.relaxng.translate.Driver lqn-sub.rng lqn-sub.rnc

When (and if) all this java stuff used for conversion gets stuck in
one place, the conversion will be moved into the Makefile and the .rnc
files will be removed from the repository.  Right now, they're
generated by hand.
