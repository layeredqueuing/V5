DMG file:

[From http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Technical/2001-03-29.01.html]

Apple encourages developers to distribute applications that don't
require an installer as disk image (.dmg) files. These allow users to
drag the files from a 'virtual' disk volume to the location where they
would like to have them on their hard drive.

There are several different types of disk images. Standard .img files
are a dual fork format, and require MacBinary encoding to transfer via
the web or FTP. A second format, .dmg, are a single fork format. These
require no additional encoding to transfer.

There isn't currently a nice GUI tool for creating .dmg files on Mac
OS X 10.0. You can still create them, but you need to resort to the
command line tools hdiutil, hdid and newfs_hfs.

A typical process for doing this as as follows.

1. Create a writeable disk image (adjust the size according to your
   needs, the blank space is compressed)

     hdiutil create -megabytes 50 lqns-5.4.dmg -layout NONE

2. Next, you want to mount the image. However you do not want the
   system to be notified of the mount, so you must used the -nomount
   command.

     hdid -nomount lqns-5.4.dmg

This command will return a /dev/disk<somenumber> of the mounted image,
you'll need to use that in some of the following steps.

3. Now we need to format the mounted disk image as an HFS+ volume and
   give it the <volume name> that it will mount under in the
   Finder.. Note that you need to substitute the /dev/disk<somenumber>
   from above. You will be asked for the administrator password when
   you enter this command.

     sudo newfs_hfs -v lqns /dev/disk<somenumber>

4. Unmount (eject) the formatted volume from the system. Again, note
   the substitution

     hdiutil eject /dev/disk<somenumber>

5. and finally, we need to mount the image editable

     hdid lqns-5.4.dmg

You'll now have a new volume showing up in the Finder that is called lqns.

6. Use the Finder to copy and arrange your files on the image, and
   when you are finished, eject the volume. This doesn't always work,
   the Finder might complain that it is in use. In these cases, it
   seems necessary to reboot.

   cd /opt
   find . \( -name 'liblq*' -o -name 'lq*' -o -name 'srvn*' \) -depth -print | cpio -pd /Volumes/lqns

7. Once you've finished copying items to your volume and ejected it,
   you need to convert the read-write version to a read-only version
   using the following command.

If your dmg files are intended for 10.1 or above, you can force them
to be compressed using the zlib algorithms (which are significantly
more efficient at making smaller archives) by changing one letter
(UDCO to UDZO) when you convert it to the final image.

     hdiutil convert -format UDZO lqns-5.4.dmg -o lqns-5.4.z.dmg

You now have a distributable disk image. And if you're releasing
software, be sure to add it to Softrak.

9) Create Mac Installer
Screen Next we'll create a Mac installer.  Using "Finder", navigate
into the "Developer:Applications:Utilities" folder and double-click
"PackageMaker".  (Prior to OS X Panther [10.4], the names of the
fields, tabs, and menu items in the steps below are a little
different, but they do the same thing).

Steps:

   1. On the first screen, select "Single Package Project" and click
      "OK".
   2. In the "Title:" field enter "Layered Queuing Network Solver".
   3. Click the "Contents" tab.  Then use the "Root:" chooser button
      to locate the "Show Time Mac App" folder and "Open" it.
   4. On the "Configuration" tab in the "Default Location:" field,
      enter "/Applications".
   5. Check the flags "Allow Revert to Previous Version" and
      "Relocatable".
   6. On the "Package Version" tab, fill out the fields as follows.
      Identifier:  com.centerkey.showtime
      Get Info String:  Show Time 1.0
      Version:  1.0
   7. Go to the "Project" menu and select "Build...".
   8. In the "Save As:" field, enter "ShowTimeInstaller.pkg".
   9. Navigate into the "ItsShowtime" folder and click the "Save"
      button. 

You'll be given the option to save your installer settings when you
quit "PackageMaker".
