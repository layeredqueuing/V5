# Revision 12.1  1996/03/29  16:14:16  greg
# Latest compilation headaches.
#

Sun4:
  -O2 and -01 optimization with gcc bomb.

Solaris:
  -O2 optimization for solaris cc breaks parasolve.c Use -O1 (-xO1).

-------
We use a slightly customized version of parasol.
1) #define ps_my_schedule_time	(ps_htp->sched_time) was added 
   to enable parasrvn to determine the time the task was scheduled
   so that we can report delay to schedule statistics.

2) SYSCALL ps_receive_priority() and SYSCALL ps_send_priority()
   were added to permit priority message queues.
