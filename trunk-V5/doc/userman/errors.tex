\chapter{Error Messages}
\label{sec:error-messages}

Error messages are classified into four categories ranging from the
most severe to the least, they are: fatal, error, advisory and
warning.  Fatal errors will cause the program to exit immediately.
All other error messages will stop the solution of the current model
and suppress output generation.  However, subsequent input files will
be processed.  Advisory messages occur when the model has been solved,
but the results may not be correct.  Finally, warnings indicate
possible problems with the model which the solver has ignored.

\section{Fatal Error Messages}
\label{sec:fatal-error-messages}
\begin{itemize}
% /* FTL_INTERNAL_ERROR                  1 */
\item \texttt{Internal error}

  Something bad happened...

% /* FTL_NO_MEMORY                       2 */

\item \texttt{No more memory}

  A request for memory failed.  

% /* ERR_NO_OBJECTS                      3 */

\item \texttt{Model has no
  }\emph{(activity$|$entry$|$task$|$processor)}

  This should not happen.
  
% /* FTL_ACTIVITY_STACK_FULL           60 */
\item \texttt{Activity stack for "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" is
    full.}
  
  The stack size\indexerror{stack size} limit for task
  \emph{identifier} has been exceeded.

% /* FTL_MSG_POOL_EMPTY                61 */
\item \texttt{Message pool is empty.  Sending from
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" to "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{".}
  
  Message buffers are used when sending asynchronous send-no-reply
  messages\indexerror{send-no-reply}.  All the buffers have been
  used\indexerror{message!pool}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Error Messages}
\label{sec:normal-error-messages}

\begin{itemize}
% /* ERR_REPLICATION                   62 */
\item \emph{(task$|$processor)}\texttt{ "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{":
    Replication not supported.}\marginpar{lqsim}
  
  The simulator\index{replication!simulator} does not support
  replication\indexerror{replication}.  The model can be
  ``flattened''\index{replication!flatten} using
  \manpage{rep2flat}{1}.

% /* ERR_NON_UNITY_REPLIES               4 */
\item \emph{n.n} \texttt{Replies generated by Entry
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{".}
  
  This error occurs when an entry is supposed to generate a reply
  because it accepts rendezvous\index{rendezvous} requests, but the
  activity graph does not generate exactly one
  reply\indexerror{reply}.  Common causes of this error are replies
  being generated by two or more branches of an
  AND-fork\indexerror{AND-fork!reply}, or replies being generated as
  part of a LOOP\indexerror{LOOP!reply}\footnote{Replies cannot be
    generated by branches of loops because the number of iterations of
    the loop is random, not deterministic}.

% /* ERR_IS_START_ACTIVITY               5 */
\item \texttt{Activity "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" is a start
    activity.}
  
  The activity named \emph{identifier} is the first activity in an
  activity graph\indexerror{start activity}.  It cannot be used in a
  \emph{post-}precedence\indexerror{post-precedence}
  (\emph{fork-}list\indexerror{fork-list}).

% /* ERR_DUPLICATE_ACTIVITY_RVALUE       6 */
\item \texttt{Activity "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" previously used in
    a fork." }
  
  The activity \emph{identifier} has already been used as part of a
  fork expression\indexerror{fork-list}.  Fork lists are on the right
  hand side of the \texttt{->}\index{->@\texttt{->}} operator in the old
  grammar, and are the
  \emph{post}-precedence\indexerror{post-precedence} expressions in
  the XML grammar.  This error will cause a loop in the activity
  graph.

% /* ERR_DUPLICATE_ACTIVITY_LVALUE       7 */
\item \texttt{Activity "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" previously used in
    a join." }
  
  The activity \emph{identifier} has already been used as part of a
  join list\indexerror{join-list}.  Join lists are on the left hand
  side of the \texttt{->}\index{\texttt{->}} operator in the old
  grammar, and are the
  \emph{pre}-precedence\indexerror{pre-precedence} expressions in the
  XML grammar.  This error will cause a loop in the activity graph.

% /* ERR_REPLY_NOT_FOUND               63 */
\item \texttt{Activity "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" requests reply for
    entry "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" but none
    pending.}\marginpar{lqsim}
  
  The simulator is trying to generate a reply\indexerror{reply} from
  entry \emph{identifier}, but there are no messages queued at the
  entry.  This error usually means there is a logic error in the
  simulator.

% /* ERR_LQX_COMPILATION                    */
\item \texttt{An error occured while compiling the LQX program found in file: }\emph{filename}\texttt`{.}\marginpar{lqx}
  
  A syntax error was found in the LQX\indexerror{LQX} program found in the file \emph{filename}.  Refer to
  earlier error messages.

% /* ERR_LQX_EXECUTION                      */
\item \texttt{An error occured  executing the LQX program found in file: }\emph{filename}\texttt{.}\marginpar{lqx}
  
  A error occured while executing the the LQX\indexerror{LQX} program found in the file \emph{filename}.
  Refer to earlier error messages.

% /* ERR_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING               8 */
\item \texttt{Attribute "}\emph{attribute}\texttt{" is missing from
    "}\emph{type}\texttt{" element.}

  The attribute named \emph{attribute} for the \texttt{type}-element
  is missing\indexerror{attribute!missing}.
  
%  ---- SCHEMA
\item \texttt{Attribute '}\emph{attribute}\texttt{' is not declared
    for element '}\emph{element}\texttt{'}
  
  The attribute named \emph{attribute} for \emph{element} is not defined in the
  schema.\indexerror{attribute!not declared}.  

% /* ERR_CANNOT_CREATE_X               64 */
\item \texttt{Cannot create }\emph{(processor$|$processor for
    task$|$task})\texttt{
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{".}\marginpar{lqsim}
  
  Parasol\indexerror{Parasol} could not create an object such as a
  task\indexerror{task creation} or
  processor\indexerror{processor!creation}.

% /* ERR_CYCLE_IN_ACTIVITY_GRAPH         9 */
\item \texttt{Cycle in activity graph for task
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{", back trace is
    "}\emph{list}\texttt{".}
  
  There is a cycle in the activity graph for the task named
  \emph{identifier}\indexerror{cycle!activity graph}.  Activity graphs
  must be acyclic.  \emph{List} identifies the activities found in the
  cycle.

% /* ERR_CYCLE_IN_CALL_GRAPH            10 */
\item \texttt{Cycle in call graph,  backtrace is "}\emph{list}\texttt{".}
  
  There is a cycle in the call graph\indexerror{cycle!call graph}
  indicating either a possible deadlock\index{deadlock} or livelock
  condition.  A deadlock can occur if the same task, but via a
  different entry, is called in the cycle of
  rendezvous\index{rendezvous!cycle} indentified by \emph{list}.  A
  livelock\index{livelock} can occur if the same task and entry are
  found in the cycle.

  In general, call graphs must be acyclic.  If a deadlock condition is
  identified, the \pragma{cycles=allow} pragma can be used to suppress
  the error.  Livelock conditions cannot be suppressed as these
  indicate an infinite loop in the call graph\index{infinite loop!call graph}.

% /* ERR_TOO_MANY_PHASES                11 */
\item \texttt{Data for }\emph{n}\texttt{ phases specified.  Maximum permitted is }\emph{m}\texttt{.}
  
  The solver only supports \emph{m} phases (typically
  3)\indexerror{maximum phases}; data for \emph{n} phases was
  specified.  If more than \emph{m} phases need to be specified, use
  activities to define the phases.

% --- Schema --- 
\item \texttt{Datatype error: Type:InvalidDatatypeValueException,
    Message:}\emph{message}

% /* ERR_DELAY_MULTIPLY_DEFINED        65 */
\item \texttt{Delay from processor "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" to
    processor "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" previously specified.}\marginpar{lqsim}

  Inter-processor delay...\typeout{Bonne mots: inter-processor delay}

% /* ERR_BOGUS_COPIES                  61 */
\item \texttt{Derived population of }\emph{n.n}\texttt{ for task
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" is not valid."}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  The solver finds populations for the
  clients\indexerror{population!infinite} in a given submodel by
  traversing up the call graphs from all the servers in the submodel.
  If the derived population is infinite\index{submodel!population},
  the submodel cannot be solved.  This error usually arises when open
  arrivals\indexerror{open arrival} are accepted by infinite
  servers\index{server!infinite}\indexerror{infinite server}.

% /* ERR_SRC_EQUALS_DST                 12 */
\item \texttt{Destination entry "}\emph{dst-identifier}\texttt{" must
    be different from source entry "}\emph{src-identifier}\texttt{".}
  
  This error occurs when \emph{src-identifier} and
  \emph{dst-identifier} specify the same
  entry.\indexerror{entry!different}

% /* ERR_NON_INTEGRAL_CALLS             13 */
\item \texttt{Deterministic phase "}\emph{src-identifier}\texttt{"
    makes a non-integral number of calls (}\emph{n.n}\texttt{) to
    entry }\emph{dst-identifier}\texttt{.}
  
  This error occurs when a deterministic
  phase\indexerror{phase!deterministic} or activity makes a
  non-integral number of calls to some other entry.

% --- SCHEMA_DUPLICATE_UNIQUE_VALUE --- 
\item \texttt{Duplicate unique value declared for identity constraint
    of element '}\emph{task}\texttt{'.}
  
  One or more activities are being bound to the same
  entry\indexerror{duplicate!unique value}.  This is not allowed, as
  an entry is only allowed to be bound to one activity.  Check all
  \attribute{bound-to-entry} attributes for all activities to ensure
  this constraint is being met.

% --- SCHEMA --- 
\item \texttt{Duplicate unique value declared for identity constraint
    of element '}\emph{lqn-model}\texttt{'.}
  
  This error indicated that an element has a duplicate
  name\indexerror{element!duplicate name}\indexerror{duplicate!unique value}
  -- the parser gives the line number to the start of the second
  instance of duplicate element.  The following elements must have
  unique name attributes\index{attribute!unique name}, but the
  uniqueness does not span elements.  Therefore a processor and task
  element can have the same name attribute, but two processor elements
  cannot have the same name attribute.
  
  The following elements must have a unique \attribute{name}
  attribute:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item processor
  \item task
  \item entry
  \end{itemize}

% Value '}\emph{value}\texttt{' does not match any member types (of the union).
% Value 'fred' is not in enumeration .

\item \texttt{Empty content not valid for content
    model:'}\emph{element}\texttt{'}

(result-processor,task)

% /* ERR_OPEN_AND_CLOSED_CLASSES        14 */
\item \texttt{Entry "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{"  accepts both
    rendezvous and send-no-reply messages.}

  An entry can either accept synchronous messages (to which it
  generates replies), or asynchronous messages (to which no reply is
  needed), but not both.  Send the requests to two separate
  entries.\indexerror{entry!message type}

% /* ERR_INVALID_FORWARDING_PROBABILITY 15 */
\item \texttt{Entry "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" has invalid
    forwarding probability of }\emph{n.n}\texttt{.}
  
  This error occurs when the sum of all forwarding
  probabilities\indexerror{forwarding!probability} from the entry
  \emph{identifier} is greater than 1\index{probability!forwarding}.

% /* ERR_WRONG_TASK_FOR_ENTRY           16 */
\item \texttt{Entry "}\emph{entry-identifier}\texttt{"  is not part of task
    "}\emph{task-identifier}\texttt{".}
  
  An activity graph part of task \emph{task-identifer}
  replies\indexerror{activity!reply} to \emph{entry-identifier}.
  However, \emph{entry-identifier} belongs to another task.

% /* ERR_ENTRY_NOT_SPECIFIED            17 */
\item \texttt{Entry "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" is not specified.}
  
  An entry is declared but not defined, either using phases or
  activities\indexerror{entry}.  An entry is
  ``defined''\index{entry!defined} when some parameter such as service
  time is specified.

% /* ERR_REPLY_NOT_GENERATED            18 */
\item \texttt{Entry "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" must reply; the reply
    is not specified in the activity graph.}
  
  The entry \emph{identifier} accepts rendezvous
  requests\indexerror{activity!reply}.  However, no reply is specified
  in the activity graph.

% /* ERR_MIXED_ENTRY_TYPES              19 */
\item \texttt{Entry "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" specified using both
    activity and phase methods.}
  
  Entries can be specified either using phases\index{entry!phase}, or
  using activities\index{entry!activity}, but not
  both.\indexerror{entry!type}.

% /* ERR_MIXED_SPECIAL_ENTRY_TYPES              19 */
\item \texttt{Entry "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" specified as both a signal and wait.}
  
  A semaphore task\index{task!semaphore}\index{semaphore task} must have exactly one
  signal\index{entry!signal}\index{signal} and one wait\index{entry!wait}\index{wait} entry.  Both entries
  have the same type.\indexerror{entry!type}.

% --- SCHEMA ----
% Expected end of tag 'synch-call'

\item \texttt{Expected end of tag '}\emph{element}\texttt{'}

  The closing tag\indexerror{tag!end} for \emph{element} was not found in the input file.

% /* ERR_EXTERNAL_SYNC                 62 */
\item \texttt{External synchronization not supported for task
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" at join
    "}\emph{join-list}\texttt{".}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  The analytic solver does not implement external synchronization\indexerror{synchronization}.

% /* ERR_LQX_VARIABLE_RESOLUTION            */
\item \texttt{External variables are present in file "}\emph{filename}\texttt{, but there is no LQX program
    to resolve them.}\marginpar{lqx}
  
  The input model contains a variable\indexerror{external variable} of the form ``\texttt{\$var}'' as a
  parameter such as a service time, multiplicty, or rate.  The variables are only assigned values when an
  LQX program executes.  Since no LQX program\indexerror{LQX!execution} was present in the model file, the
  model cannot be solved.

% /* ERR_FANIN_MISMATCH                63 */
\item \texttt{Fan-ins from task "}\emph{from-identifier}\texttt{" to
    task "}\emph{to-identifier}\texttt{" are not identical for all
    calls.}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  All requests\indexerror{fan-in} made from task
  \emph{from-identifier} to task \emph{to-identifier} must have the
  same fan-in and fan-out values\indexerror{fan-out}.

% /* ERR_REPLICATION                   68 */
\item \texttt{Fan-out from }\emph{(activity$|$entry$|$task)}\texttt{
    "}\emph{src-identifier}\texttt{" (}\emph{n}\texttt{ *
  }\emph{n}\texttt{ replicas) does not match fan-in to
  }\emph{(entry$|$processor)}\texttt{ "}\emph{dst-identifier}\texttt{"
    (}\emph{n}\texttt{ * }\emph{n}\texttt{).}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  This error occurs when the number of replicas\indexerror{replication}
  at \emph{src-identifier} multiplied by the
  fan-out\indexerror{fan-out} for the request to \emph{dst-identifier}
  does not match the number of replicas at \emph{dst-identifier}
  multiplied by the fan-in\indexerror{fan-in} for the request from
  \emph{src-identifier}. A fan-in or fan-out of zero (a common error
  case) can arise when the ratios of tasks to processors is
  non-integral\index{replication!ratio}.

% /* ERR_LESS_ENTRIES_THAN_TASKS        20 */
\item \texttt{Fewer entries defined (}\emph{n}\texttt{) than tasks
    (}\emph{m}\texttt{).}
  
  A model was specified with more tasks than entries.  Since each task
  must have at least one entry, this model is
  invalid\indexerror{model}.

% /* ERR_NO_TASK_DEFINED_FOR_GROUP        */
\item \texttt{Group "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" has no tasks.}
  \indexerror{group!tasks}
  
  The group named by \emph{identifier} has no tasks assigned to it.  A group requires a minimum of one task.

% /* ERR_INVALID_SHARE                    */ 
\item \texttt{Group "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" has invalid share of }\emph{n.n}\texttt{.}
  \indexerror{group!share}

  The share\index{group!share} value of \emph{n.n} for group \emph{identifier} is not between the range of $
  0 < n.n <= 1.0$.

% /* ERR_INFINITE_THROUGHPUT           64 */
\item \texttt{Infinite throughput for task
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{".  Model specification
    error.}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  The response time\indexerror{response time} for the task
  \emph{identifier} is zero\indexerror{throughput!infinite}.  The
  likely cause is zero service time for all calls made by the task.

% /* ERR_INIT_DELAY                    66 */
\item \texttt{Initial delay of }\emph{n.n}\texttt{ is too small,
  }\emph{n}\texttt{ client(s) still running.}\marginpar{lqsim}
  
  This error occurs when the \emph{initial-loops}\index{initial-loops}
  parameter for automatic
  blocking\index{automatic blocking}\index{block!automatic} is too
  small.

% /* ERR_INVALID_FANIN                 65 */
\item \texttt{Invalid fan-in of }\emph{n}\texttt{: source task
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" is not replicated.}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  The fan-in\indexerror{fan-in} value for a request specifies the
  number of replicated\indexerror{replication} source tasks making a
  call to the destination.  To correct this error, the source task
  needs to be replicated by a multiple of $n$.

% /* ERR_INVALID_FANOUT                66 */
\item \texttt{Invalid fan-out of }\emph{n}\texttt{: destination task
    "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" has only }\emph{m}\texttt{
    replicas.}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  The fan-out\indexerror{fan-out} value $n$ is larger than the number
  of destination tasks $m$.  In effect, the source will have more than
  one request arc to the destination.

% /* ERR_JOIN_BAD_PATH                  21 */
\item \texttt{Invalid path to join "}\emph{join-list}\texttt{" for
    task "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{": backtrace is
    "}\emph{list}\texttt{".}
  
  The activity graph\indexerror{activity graph} for task
  \emph{identifer} is invalid because the branches to the
  join\indexerror{join} \emph{join-list} do not all originate from the
  same fork\indexerror{fork}.  \emph{List} is a dump of the activity
  stack when the error occurred.

% /* ERR_INVALID_PROBABILITY            22 */
\item \texttt{Invalid probability of }\emph{n.n}\texttt{.}
  
  The probability\indexerror{probability} of \emph{n.n} is not between
  the range of zero to one inclusive.  The likely cause for this error
  is the sum of the
  probabilities\index{branch!probability}\index{forwarding!probability}\index{probability!branch}\index{probability!forwarding}
  either from an OR-fork\index{OR-fork}, or from
  forwarding\index{forwarding} from an entry, is greater than one.

% /* ERR_MULTIPLY_DEFINED               23 */
\item \texttt{Name "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" previously defined.}
  
  The symbol
  \emph{identifer}\indexerror{duplicate!identifier}\index{identifier!duplicate}
  was previously defined.  Tasks, processors and entries must all be
  named uniquely.  Activities must be named uniquely within a task.

% /* ERR_NO_REFERENCE_TASKS             24 */
\item \texttt{Model has no reference tasks.}
  
  There are no reference tasks\indexerror{reference task} nor are there
  any tasks with open arrivals\indexerror{open arrival} specified in
  the model.  Reference tasks serve as customers for closed queueing
  models\index{queueing model!customers}\index{queueing model!closed}.
  Open-arrivals serve as sources for open queueing
  models\index{queueing model!open}.

% /* ERR_NO_CALLS_TO_ENTRY             67 */
\item \texttt{No calls from }\emph{(entry$|$activity)}\texttt{
    "}\emph{from-identifier}\texttt{" to entry
    "}\emph{to-identifier}\texttt{".}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  This error occurs when the fan-in\indexerror{fan-in} or
  fan-out\indexerror{fan-out} parameter for a request are specified
  \emph{before} the actual request type.  Switch the order in the
  input file.

% /* ERR_NO_QUANTUM_SCHEDULING            */
\item \texttt{No group specified for task "}\emph{task\_identifier}\texttt{" running on processor
    "}\emph{proc\_identifier}\texttt{" using fair share scheduling.}

  Task \emph{task\_identifier} has no group specified, yet it is running on processor
  \emph{proc\_identifier} which is using completely fair scheduling\indexerror{scheduling!completely fair}.

% /* ERR_NO_SEMAPHORE                 26 */
\item \texttt{No signal or wait specified for semaphore task "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{".}
  
  Task \emph{identifier} has been identified as a semaphore\indexerror{semaphore task}
  task\index{task!semaphore}, but neither of its entries has been designated as a

% /* ERR_NON_REF_THINK_TIME             25 */
\item \texttt{Non-reference task "}\emph{identifier}\texttt{" cannot
    have think time.}
  
  A think time\indexerror{think time} is specified for a non-reference
  task.  Think times for non-reference tasks can only be specified by
  entry\index{think time!entry}.

% /* ERR_NOT_SEMAPHORE_TASK */
\item \texttt{Non-semaphore task "}\emph{identifer}\texttt{" cannot have a }\emph{(signal|wait)}\texttt{ for

  }\emph{n.n}\texttt{.}\marginpar{lqns}
  
  The open arrival rate of $n.n$ to entry
  \emph{identifier}\indexerror{open arrival} is too high, so the input
  queue to the task has overflowed.  This error may be the result of a
  transient condition, so the \pragma{stop-on-message-loss} pragma
  (c.f. \S\ref{sec:lqns-pragmas}) may be used to suppress this error.
  If the arrival rate exceeds the service time at the time the model
  converges, then the waiting time results for the entry will show
  infinity\index{infinity}.  Note that if a task accepts both open and
  closed classes\index{class!open}\index{class!closed}, an overflow in
  the open class will result in zero throughput\index{throughput!zero}
  for the closed classes.

\section{Input File Parser Error Messages}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{error: not well-formed (invalid token)}

  This error occurs when an XML input file is expected, but some other

  When this message appears, Xerces\index{Xerces} does \textbf{not} provide many hints on where the actual
  error occurs because it always gives a line number which points to the end of the file (i.e. where the
  terminating tag \verb!</lqn-model>! is).

  In this case, the following three points should be inspected to
  ensure validity of the model:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item All synchronous calls have a \attribute{dest} attribute which
    refers to a valid entry\indexerror{rendezvous}.
  \item All asynchronous calls have a \attribute{dest} attribute which
    refers to a valid entry\indexerror{send-no-reply}.
  \item All forwarding calls have a \attribute{dest} attribute which
    refers to a valid entry\indexerror{forward}.
  \end{enumerate}

  If it is not practical to manually inspect the model, run the XML
  file through another tool like XMLSpy or XSDvalid which will report
  more descriptive errors.
  
\item \texttt{The key for identity constraint of element '}\emph{task}\texttt{' is not found.}
  
  When this error appears, it means there is something wrong within
  the \schemaelement{task} element indicated by the line number.
  Check that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The name \attribute{attribute} of all

% --- SCHEMA_KEY_FOR_IDENTITY_CONSTRAINT ---
\item \texttt{The key for identity constraint of element

  \item The head attribute of all \schemaelement{post-loop} elements
    refers to an activity defined within the mentioned
    \schemaelement{task-activities} element.
