lqsim:     Simulator for Layered Queueing Networks
srvndiff:  Result comparison program.
parasol:   Event-driven Simulation package.
lqiolib:   LQN/SRVN input/output file parsing library.
lqn2ps:    LQN file format converter.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Unix variants)
----------------------------------

To build and install from the distribution tarball using the gcc/g++
compiler:

./configure
make
make install

Please refer to the file INSTALL for more information.

To bootstrap the build process above, run the file .bootstrap in the
src directory.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Windows)
----------------------------
There are three options: MinGW, Cygwin, and DJGPP.  Use MingGW for
distribution as it builds native executables in Win32 mode.  DJGPP
builds WIN16 executables (and has problems with cross device files).
Cygwin requires special libraries for Unix emulation.  Cygwin is
probably the best choice for development.

If using MinGW:
1) Install mingw.  It's relatively painless now.
   - Add groff: mingw-get install msys-groff
   - Add expat: mingw-get install mingw32-libexpat

./bootstrap
./configure-mingw
make
make install

2) The user manuals are built using LaTeX and 
   Install miktex - http://www.miktex.org/
   Install ghostview - http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
   Install fig2dev - http://schmidt-web-berlin.de/winfig.htm

   Modify %PATH% to point to the bin directories of the above four packages. 
   See: My Computer -> Change a setting -> Performance and Maintenance -> System ->
   Advanced -> Environment Variables

If using Cygwin:
Note: Be sure that tetex, groff, and xfree (for ps2pdf) are all
installed!  

./configure
make
make install

lqns must be executed from the cygwin environment.
