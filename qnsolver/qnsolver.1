.SH "NAME"
qnsolver \- Solve a conventional BCMP queueing network model using Mean Value Analysis
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.br
.B qnsolver
[\fIOPTION \&.\|.\|.\fP] [\fIFILE\fR \&.\|.\|. ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBqnsolver\fP is used to conventional BCMP queueing network models
using Exact or Approximate Mean Value Analysis.  The input file format
is that of the Java Modeling Tools (with extensions to handle the SPEX
modeling languge used by lqns(1).)  If a ``What-If'' element is found
in the input file, output is either CSV, or a self-contained file that
can be used with gnuplot(1) to plot the results.  Otherwise, the
results for the model are printed.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-bounds\fR
Use the Bounds solver to solve the model(s).  Bounds are computed
implicitly with \fB\-\-plot\-throughput\fR and
\fB\-\-plot\-response\-time\fR.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\-mva\fR
Use Exact Mean Value Analysis to solve the model(s).
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-linearizer\fR
Use Linearizer approximate MVA to solve the model(s).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-bard\-schweitzer\fR
Use Bard\-Schweitzer approximate MVA to solve the model(s).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-fast\-linearizer\fR
Use ``Fast Linearizer'' approximate MVA to solve the model(s).
.TP
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIarg\fR
Direct analysis results to \fIoutput\fP.  A filename of `\fI-\fR'
directs output to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-plot\-queue\-length\fR=\fIarg\fR
Generate gnuplot(1) output to plot the queue length (number of
customers) for either all stations for the class named \fIarg\fP, or
for all classes for the station named \fIarg\fP.  The independent
``What-If'' variable is used as the X-axis.  
.TP
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-plot\-response\-time\fR
Generate gnuplot(1) output for plotting the response time and bounds for the
system from the solution of a ``What-If'' model.  The response time
does not include the residence times for the reference station.
The independent ``What-If'' variable is used for the X-axis.  
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-plot\-throughput\fR[=\fIarg\fR]
Generate gnuplot(1) output for plotting the throughput.  If the
optional \fIarg\fP is present, the throughput is plotted for all
stations for the class named \fIarg\fP, or for all classes for the
station named \fIarg\fP.  If the optional \fIarg\fP is not present,
generate gnuplot to plot the throughput and throughput bounds for the
``Reference Station'' from the
solution of a ``What-If'' model. The independent ``What-If''
variable is used for the X-axis.  
.IP
If a What-If analysis of population
mix is specified in the input file, then the throughput and bounds for the second
class is plotted versus the throughput and bounds for the first class.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-\-plot\-utilization\fR
Generate gnuplot(1) output for plotting the utilization for the for either all stations
for the class named \fIarg\fP, or for all classes for the station
named \fIarg\fP.  The independent ``What-If'' variable is used for the X-axis.
The independent ``What-If''
variable is used for the X-axis.  
.TP
\fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-plot\-waiting\-time\fR
Generate gnuplot(1) output for plotting the waiting time for either all stations
for the class named \fIarg\fP, or for all classes for the station
named \fIarg\fP.  The independent ``What-If'' variable is used for the X-axis.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fP, \fB\-\-export\-qnap\fR
Convert the input model into QNAP.  The conversion \fIdoes not\fP translate
class or station names into a form suitable for QNAP2 (i.e., no more than
eight characters and no spaces for station and class names).
.TP
\fB\-X\fP, \fB\-\-debug\-xml\fR
Debug XML input.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP, \fB\-\-debug\-spex\fR
Output the SPEX program generated.
