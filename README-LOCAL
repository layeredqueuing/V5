BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Unix variants)
----------------------------------

You require:
  flex
  bison
  gcc-c++
  expat
  automake
  libtool
  gd-devel (optional for png/jpeg output)
  texlive (optional for documentation)
  texlive-epsf (optional for documentation)
  xfig (optional for documentation)
  fig2dev (optional for documentation)
for a complete build (sudo dnf install ...; apt-get install ...).

To build and install from the distribution tarball using the gcc/g++
compiler:

./configure
make
make install

Please refer to the file INSTALL for more information.

To bootstrap the build process above, run the file .bootstrap in the
src directory.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Ubuntu 64 bit)
----------------------------------

The simulator does not execute on a 64 bit environment, so it is
necessary to build a 32 bit version:

sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
./.configure-ubuntu	      # to use -m32
make
make install

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Windows)
----------------------------
There are three options: MinGW, MinGW2, Cygwin, and DJGPP.  Use MinGW2 for
distribution as it builds native executables in Win32 mode.  Cygwin is
probably the best choice for development.  I believe the original MinGW is no 
longer supported.  DJGPP builds for DOS.

If using MinGW2 
1) Install mingw2 (See msys2.org).  It's relatively painless now.
   - Update packages to latest:
     % pacman -Syu
   - I recommend to you install most used developer apps by:
     % pacman -S base-devel
   - You can run MSYS2 with mingw32_shell.bat and install mingw-w64 toolchain:
     % pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain

2) Install other libraries for mingw.
   None needed with the above.

3) The user manuals are built using LaTeX and 
   Install miktex - http://www.miktex.org/
   Install ghostview - http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/

   Modify %PATH% to point to the bin directories of the above three packages. 
   See: My Computer -> Change a setting -> Performance and Maintenance -> System ->
   Advanced -> Environment Variables

   ** For msys64, you have to set the PATH in .bashrc

4) Build away...
   ** Make sure that you run the 32 bit version of MINGW (Programs->MSYS2 32bit->MinGW-wew Win64 Shell)
   ** You need /mingw32/bin/gcc

   If buidling from the repo:
   ./.bootstrap
   ./.configure-mingw32
   make
   make install

   If building from lqns-?.??.tar.gz:
   ./configure --disable-shared LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib' CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include' CXXFLAGS='-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc'
   make
   make install

5) To install on Windows:
   Install the Nullsoft Installer.  (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)
   go to dist/win-nt
   Run the NSI Installer on the installer scripts.
   Run the installer.


If using Cygwin:
Note: Be sure that tetex, groff, and xfree (for ps2pdf) are all
installed!  

./configure
make
make install

lqns must be executed from the cygwin environment.
