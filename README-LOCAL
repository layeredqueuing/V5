BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Unix variants)
----------------------------------

You require:
  flex
  bison
  gcc-c++ (or clang++, or...)
  expat
  groff (man pages)
  automake
  libtool
  gd-devel (optional for png/jpeg output)
  texlive (optional for documentation)
  texlive-epsf (optional for documentation)
  xfig (optional for documentation)
  fig2dev (optional for documentation)
for a complete build.

To build and install from the distribution tarball using the gcc/g++
compiler:

./configure
make
make install

Please refer to the file INSTALL for more information.

If building from source files fetched directly from the git
repository, you need to bootstrap the build process.  Run:

autoreconf -i

Then follow the instructions for the tarball.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Ubuntu 64 bit)
----------------------------------

The simulator does not execute on a 64 bit environment using gcc, so
it is necessary to build a 32 bit version, or use clang (preferred).

sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
autoreconf -i		      # optional
./.configure-m32	      # to use -m32
make
make install

On ubuntu, you must add -stdlib=libc++ as a clang++ option in order to
find the Standard Template Library.

sudo apt install clang
autoreconf -i		      # optional
./.configure-llvm-ubuntu      # Adds -stdlib=libc++
make
make install

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Windows)
----------------------------
There are four options: MinGW, MinGW2, Cygwin, and DJGPP.  Use MinGW2
for distribution as it builds native executables in Win32 mode.
Cygwin is probably the best choice for development, though MinGW2 is
good enough.  I believe the original MinGW is no longer supported.
DJGPP builds for DOS.

Windows does not have symbolic links, so the regression tests cannot
be run easily using 'make check'.

If using MinGW2 
1) Install mingw2 (See msys2.org).  It's relatively painless compared to MinGW.
   - Update packages to latest:
     % pacman -Syu
     % pacman -Su
   - I recommend to you install most used developer apps by:
     % pacman -S base-devel
   - for automake and friends:
     % pacman -S autotools
     % pacman -S groff
   - You can run MSYS2 with mingw32_shell.bat and install mingw-w64 toolchain:
     % pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
   - Ghostscript is needed to build .pdf manual pages.
     % pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-ghostscript

2) Install other libraries for mingw.
   None needed with the above.

3) The user manuals are built using LaTeX.
   Install texlive
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-texlive-full

   ** For msys64, you have to set the PATH in .bashrc
  PATH=$PATH:/mingw64/bin

4) Build away...
   ** Make sure that you run the 32 bit version of MINGW (Programs->MSYS2 32bit->MinGW-wew Win64 Shell)
   ** You need /mingw32/bin/gcc

   If buidling from the repo:
   autoreconf -i
   ./.configure-mingw32
   make
   make install

   If building from lqns-?.??.tar.gz:
   ./configure --disable-shared LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib' CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include' CXXFLAGS='-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc'
   make
   make install

5) To install on Windows:
   Install the Nullsoft Installer.  (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)
   go to dist/win-nt
   Run the NSI Installer on the installer scripts.
   Run the installer.


If using Cygwin:
Note: Be sure that tetex, groff, and xfree (for ps2pdf) are all
installed!  

autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install

lqns must be executed from the cygwin environment.
