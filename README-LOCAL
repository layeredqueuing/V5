lqsim:     Simulator for Layered Queueing Networks
srvndiff:  Result comparison program.
parasol:   Event-driven Simulation package.
lqiolib:   LQN/SRVN input/output file parsing library.
lqn2ps:    LQN file format converter.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Unix variants)
----------------------------------

To build and install from the distribution tarball using the gcc/g++
compiler:

./configure
make
make install

Please refer to the file INSTALL for more information.

To bootstrap the build process above, run the file .bootstrap in the
src directory.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Windows)
----------------------------
There are three options: MinGW, MinGW2, Cygwin, and DJGPP.  Use MinGW2 for
distribution as it builds native executables in Win32 mode.  Cygwin is
probably the best choice for development.  I believe the original MinGW is no 
longer supported.  DJGPP builds for DOS.

If using MinGW2:
1) Install mingw2.  It's relatively painless now.
   - Update packages to latest:
     % pacman -Syu
   - I recommend to you install most used developer apps by:
     % pacman -S base-devel
   - You can run MSYS2 with mingw32_shell.bat and install mingw-w64 toolchain:
     % pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain

2) Install other libraries for mingw.
   Install expat - 

3) The user manuals are built using LaTeX and 
   Install miktex - http://www.miktex.org/
   Install ghostview - http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
   Install fig2dev - http://schmidt-web-berlin.de/winfig.htm

   Modify %PATH% to point to the bin directories of the above four packages. 
   See: My Computer -> Change a setting -> Performance and Maintenance -> System ->
   Advanced -> Environment Variables

   ** For msys64, you have to set the PATH in .bashrc

4) Build away...
   ** Make sure that you run the 64 bit version of MINGW (Programs->MSYS2 64bit->MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell)
   ** You need /mingw64/bin/gcc

   ./bootstrap
   ./configure-mingw
   make
   make install



If using Cygwin:
Note: Be sure that tetex, groff, and xfree (for ps2pdf) are all
installed!  

./configure
make
make install

lqns must be executed from the cygwin environment.
