	  -h is now used for semaphore holding times.

2005-11-26  greg franks  <rgfranks@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

	* lqsim (V3_10)
	- results for join delays now specify the first and last activity
	  in the join list, rather than the activity prior to the fork and 
	  after the join.  
	- join delay for synchronization servers is now output.

	* lqns (V3_10)
	- results for join delays now specify the first and last activity
	  in the join list, rather than the activity prior to the fork and 
	  after the join.

	* Schema (V1)
	- forwarding element changed to EntryCallType.  Forwarded calls

	  replication).
	
2005-11-10  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	- Convergence test changed.  Convergence is now based on the root
	  mean square of the change in utilization over all tasks and
	  processors. 

	* srvndiff (V3_9)
	- Added (+i) to print the total number of iterations (though this
	  isn't terribly useful most of the time.

2005-09-15  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* lqns (V3_8)
	- Performance improvements to MVA solver for large systems with
 	  multiple chains.

	- Tasks with and-fork-join can now be replicated.
	

2005-09-11  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* multisrvn (V3_8)
	- The order of operands for results with phases and confidence
	  intervals has been switched from "entry", "level", "phase", to
	  "entry", "phase", "level".

2005-08-03  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* lqns (V3_7)
	- New algorithm for Markov_Phased_Conway_Multi_Server::wait()
	  Utilizations are much more stable.

	* multisrvn (V3_7)
	- Added `gnusplot' and `csv' to output options.
	- Results for activities can now be plotted.
	- Result catagories `jd' (join delay) and `ot' (overtaking) added.

2005-05-31  Greg Franks  <rgfranks@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

	* srvndiff (V3_7)
	- -L moved to -@.  -L now takes a label like gnu diff.  This is
	  useful for svn diff --diff-cmd srvdiff -x "opts"

	* lqns (V3_7), lqsim.
	- exit codes made common.
	  NORMAL_TERMINATION=0, INVALID_OUTPUT=1, INVALID_INPUT=2,
	  INVALID_ARGUMENT=4, FILEIO_ERROR=8, EXCEPTION_EXIT=255
	  error codes can be `or'ed.

2005-03-22  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

2004-08-30  Greg Franks  <rgfranks@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

	* srvndiff (V3_4)
	- '-S n.n' changed to '(+|-)S n.n'.  +S reports those differences
	  that exceed n.n, -S reports the opposite.

2004-08-21  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* lqsim (V3_4)
	- Confidence interval calculation corrected.  The simulator will
	  likely take longer to meet the exit criteria specified with -A.

2004-08-03  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* lqns/parasrvn
	- XML input and output.

2004-02-07  Greg Franks  <rgfranks@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

	* lqns/parasrvn/srvn2eepic/multisrvn (V3_0)
	- these programs now all accept both the lqns input file format
	  and XML input.  See lqn.xsd and lnq-core.xsd for the XML schema
	  definitions. 
	- Waiting times for processor scheduling are now reported on a
	  per-entry (or activity) basis instead of a per-slice basis.
	- Activity loops are now generalized to more than one sub-list,
	  i.e.: a1 -> 2 * b1, 1.5 * b2, 0.2 * b3, c1;

	* srvniolib/parasrvn (V3_0)
	- probability maximum service time exceeded is now output to the
	  parseable output file.

	* srvndiff (V3_0)
	- the '-e' option (error format) is moved to '-E'.
	- '-e' is now used for probability maximum service time exceeded.
	

2003-12-05  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* spex/multisrvn (V2_23)
	- .out files are now created by default once again.

	- Bugfixes.

2003-11-25  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* spex (V2_22)
	- now runs on windows NT.  Now handles new output file format.
	- spex runs NO LONGER generate .out files by default.

2003-11-07  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* lqns
	- replication fixed.  Replication now working for activities
	  (except and-fork-join).

	* MultiSRVN
	- replication fixed for entries and activities.

	* srvn2eepic
	- replication is now displayed.

2003-10-19  Greg Franks  <rgfranks@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

	* parasrvn (V2_19)
	- Parasrvn now runs on Windows NT.

	* lqns (Known problems)
	- 1   Replication likely not working for activities
	- 10  No algorithm for phased multiservers OPEN class.
	- 11  Overtaking probabilities are calculated using CV=1
	- 29  Solution of open models with "interlocking" is inaccurtate.
	- 129 Invalid multiserver utilization for rolia multiserver (10...

2003-10-09  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* multisrvn (V2_18)
	- MultiSRVN is now compiled and built for Win32.
	- MultiSRVN now uses Perl as it's expression evaluation engine.
	  This may mean changes to complicated expresssions -- in
	  particular the '^' (exponentiation) operator is now '**'.

2003-09-25  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* lqns
	- The ignoreopen=<nn> pragma has been removed and replaced with
	  stop-on-message-loss=(false|true).  If set to true, the solver
	  will allow queues to grow to infinity (because the arrival rate
	  is too large for the server).  If set to false, the solver will
	  stop. 

	* parasrvn
	- The "halt-on-loss" pragma has been renamed to
	  "stop-on-message-loss" to match with lqns.  
	- If a queue overflows and stop-on-message-loss = false, the
	  corresponding result will be set to infinity.  Queues are fixed
	  at 1024 items.

	* srvniolib
	- "inf" and "infinity" are reserved words in the output which
	  indicate an infinite result.  The parseable output scanner will
	  pass "infinity" to applications such as srvndiff, multisrvn and
	  srvn2eepic. 
	
2003-09-24  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* multisrvn
	- Open arrival results can now be extracted from MultiSRVN.  Use:
                .wt ( .e, <entry-name> );

	* srvn2eepic
	- The +C option will colour input files based on their layer
	  (provided that NO results are present).  The default is to not
	  colourize input. 

2003-09-10  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* srvniolib 
	- A Queue length parameter (q <nn>) was added to the task
	  definition for yygram.y
	- A drop probability field was added to the xxgram.y

	* multisrvn
	- '.tq' was added to the task information to vary the task queue 
	  length.
	- '.dp' and '.dpc' were added to the result catagories to extract
	  the message drop probabilities.

2003-09-08  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* multisrvn
	- Added '.tq' to vary task queue length.
	- Added '.dp' and '.dpc' to extract message drop probabilities for
	  send-no-replies and open arrivals.

2003-09-04  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* srvn2eepic
	- The -l option (print layer number) has been moved to -Z.
	- The -l option is now used to control the output of the message
	  loss probability for send-no-replies and open-arrivals.

2003-08-13  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* srvndiff
	- The -A option (print the absolute value of an error) was moved
	  to -M (magnitude).
	- +A enables all comparison output except for variances. +AA
	  outputs variances too. -AA disables all output.  Options are
	  processed from left to right, the last option processed takes
	  precedence. 

	* srvn2eepic
	- Now compiles and runs on windows.

2003-07-20  greg franks  <rgfranks@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

	* Lqns
	- Join delays are now reported from the fork to the join.
	- Multiserver fixes for large number of copies and missing chains.

	* Parasrvn
	- join delays are now reported from the fork to the join.

	- Split RNV waiting from SNR waiting in output file.

	* Parasrvn
	- Added '-M' to NOT merge SNR and RNV waiting in .p file.
	- Corrected task utilization values to account for time waiting at
  	  processor. 
	- Split RNV waiting from SNR waiting in output file.

2003-06-24  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* Lqns
	- -zrename changed to -r
	- Now handles asynchronous sends properly.

2003-03-21  Greg Franks  <greg@sce.carleton.ca>

	* Lqns:
	- Fixed class hierarchy in lqns for markov multiservers.
	- overtaking with forwarding.
